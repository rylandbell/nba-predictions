              | Pick the winner of one NBA game each day. No point spreads. The player with the most correct picks at the end of the month wins.

              | To keep things interesting, players are only allowed to choose each team once per month. We all get to pick the Warriors once, but we also get to pick the Nets.

            p In fantasy basketball or betting against a point spread, it's not uncommon to find yourself rooting for things only loosely related to who wins the actual game.

            p The each-team-once rule forces players to think strategically. When should I pick the best teams? What about the worst teams? How many correct picks will it take to win?
